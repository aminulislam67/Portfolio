                <p>I had been assigned as TA/ST at the Department of
                    Computer Science and Engineering for programming
                    language courses since 2021. I got this opportunity four
                    times to help the students of BRAC University in
                    programming courses. My main duty was to give a
                    clear concept about OOP among the students. I also
                    worked as an ST in the department of Mathematics
                    and Natural Science.</p>
